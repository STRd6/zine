The shutters of a third-story window of the manor house flew open, and a small girl leaned out, hurling a rope to the ground below. She lugged a chair over to the window, and stood on it. She grasped the rope in both hands, and began slowly descending the pitted grey stone walls of her home. Evenly spaced knots helped her tiny hands keep hold of the thick, scratchy rope as she leaned her slender frame away for balance.

In the garden below, the girl brushed rope fibers from her hands on her leggings and smoothed out her tunic. A gust of wind whipped her black hair about her face, and she wrapped her cloak closer about her body and pulled its hood over her head.

The waxing crescent moon, partially obscured by clouds, gave little light, but the girl needed no lantern. She blinked her golden eyes rapidly a few times, letting her cat-like pupils widen enough to collect the scant light, and took in her surroundings in shades of grey. She marched off into the darkness of the nearby woods, hidden under the cover of darkness.

The girl found her favorite deer trail through the forest, almost invisible to anyone else. It wound around the ancient oak trees before descending along a sandy bank to the edge of a softly flowing river. Downstream, the rapids became rough, but here, where rocks were few and the ground was mostly level, the water pooled and was perfect for swimming.

Despite the chill of the evening, the girl removed her boots and garments and folded them neatly, placing them on a flat rock several feet from the edge of the river. She stood expectantly, letting the water lap at her toes.

She looked up as a swirling cloud emerged from a hollow tree and collected above her head. She whistled a haunting little tune and the cloud parted, wrapping itself around her body as she stepped into the water. She waded waist-deep into the water as the nanoswarm enveloped her in scaly, flexible skin from her torso all the way down her legs, ending in a tail with long fins. Opening her mouth, she inhaled some of the nanoswarm to allow her to breathe underwater, before her body slipped entirely under the rippling surface. 

The girl splashed her tail and a peal of light, uninhibited laughter echoed off the rocks as she resurfaced. She swam off into the night.

“Lady Marigold?” A young woman, shivering in the predawn air, gently shook the girl’s shoulder to rouse her. The girl, Marigold, blinked her eyes and looked to find her lady’s maid standing over her with a look of concern. Marigold lay on the sandy shore where she had fallen asleep hours before.

“Hm? Oh, no. I’m so sorry, Raina! I didn’t mean to fall asleep!” she said, brushing sand from her face as she sat up. She was still wrapped in her nanoswarm, so she whistled to them again, and they lifted away from her body and back into their hiding place in the tree. Raina retrieved the neatly folded clothing and helped her lady dress quickly.

“My lady, if you must escape the house at night, please return in a timely manner. Surely you can program your nanoswarm to remind you to come home?”
“I can, but it is awkward to swim to shore with legs if the nanoswarm leaves me when I am not yet ready. I much prefer the tail.”

Raina huffed in exasperation and said nothing further. She tamed Marigold’s long hair in a quick series of braids, which she wound around the girl’s head and pinned into place.

Marigold turned to leave, but Raina said, “Your eyes, Lady Marigold.” Marigold paused, closed her eyes, and opened them again. Gone were the cat’s eyes, replaced by dark brown eyes with the usual round pupils one would expect to see in a girl five years of age.

Raina followed her lady up the bank and back into the forest. They returned to the manor house quickly and quietly. Raina, feeling that scaling the walls of the house was undignified, had already wound Marigold’s rope back up and closed the shutters. Instead, the two of them tiptoed through the kitchen. The cook, singing loudly to herself, kneaded the day’s bread and did not hear their entrance.

Back in Marigold’s rooms, Raina started a fire. “I am not cold,” Marigold protested. “The nanoswarm helps regulate my body temperature.”
“Very well, but I have no such protection and I, too, have also been out in the cold this morning.” Raina continued building the fire until it roared in the fireplace.

Marigold disappeared into her library, a fortress of shelves she had arranged in a corner of the room adjacent to the fireplace. Books of all shapes and sizes and subjects, borrowed from the big library downstairs, whispered to her their secrets of ancient wars and mythology, poetry and architecture. Soft cushions stacked on a rug served as her seat, and Marigold resumed reading A Brief History of Nanoculture.

Breakfast arrived on a tray, which Raina placed next to Marigold on the floor. The girl held the book in one hand, and ate her toast and jam and drank her tea with the other, her eyes never leaving the pages.

A knock at the door yielded a sealed note, which, though it was addressed to Raina, was delivered to Marigold. The girl looked over the note, scowled, and snapped the book shut, mentally noting the page number.

“My uncle has summoned me,” Marigold said to Raina, who nodded in response. “I do wish that man would write to me directly.” She read the note aloud, rolling her eyes: “‘Send the Lady Marigold to me at half-past nine and ensure the child wears something befitting her station.’ He knows I can read. Why does he torment me thus?”

“Your uncle is a good man,” Raina soothed, “He has many responsibilities, and has better things to occupy his time than chastising you for coming to an audience with him dressed for a day out in the woods.”
“Formal clothing is pointless. My appearance is arbitrary. I am five, and therefore invisible anyway. I prefer being able to move freely.”

Marigold flounced to a small adjoining room where her clothing was stored, and sullenly pulled a long dress from a drawer. Light, soft grey fabric draped over her head as she put the garment on. Long, tight-fitting sleeves with inlaid lace covered her arms, and the hem of the dress, which brushed the tops of her toes, featured more of the same lace. Over the dress, she put on a long, intricately embroidered vest, and Raina helped her cinch her waist with a belt the width of her hand, encrusted with beads made of semiprecious stones. Marigold slipped her feet into soft, ghillie-style shoes made of fine leather that laced up her legs.

They sat at Marigold’s dressing table and Raina brushed Marigold’s hair before smoothing it into a full, low roll at the back of her head, pinning smaller braids around it, and placing a gold hair comb into the top of the roll. Raina carefully adjusted the small curls around Marigold’s face, and turned the girl to face her.

“You look lovely,” Raina smiled.
“I still prefer the tunic and leggings, but thank you.”

Marigold exited her rooms, followed by Raina. They descended the staircase at the end of the hall, and proceeded to the library, where Marigold’s uncle usually received her. Raina knocked, and entered.

“Lady Marigold Lavande, Duchess of Frisa.” Raina announced her lady as she slowly inclined her head, a sign of respect for the child’s uncle and guardian, Lord Therus Osmarinus, a duke in his own right of the neighboring county of Astera.

Marigold swept past Raina, stopping before her uncle and inclining her head to him. He returned the gesture of respect and motioned to a chair near the table upon which his correspondence was spread before him. Raina left the room, and Marigold sat.

“Good morning, Marigold.” Her uncle’s green eyes were kind, but she could see bags under them. He probably had not slept much the previous evening. He sat at the table opposite her.

“Good morning, Uncle.” From her perch on the chair, she could just see the letters he had been reading. She strained her eyes to see the details. She noted the seal of the Ruling Council affixed to several of the letters, and the swooping signatures of several different people. She also noted a map of the country he had pulled up on a tablet, with a variety of location markers scattered near the coast.

“What is the map for, Uncle?” Marigold asked.

Her uncle ran his fingers through his short, brown hair, speckled through with grey. He sighed. “There is some unrest along the coast. We have been summoned to the Palace of the Ruling Council for a meeting.”
“We?” Marigold raised her eyebrows. “We are never summoned. You are summoned, and I remain here and you act on my behalf.” She began to feel agitated. She liked her home, and leaving it always made her feel uneasy.
“In general, yes, but the Ruling Council specifically requested your presence this time.” Her uncle gestured toward the fireplace where a man and a woman stood, watching them.

He introduced them as Lord and Lady Sicale, and explained that he must accompany them now to the Palace, and that Marigold would follow along as soon as possible. Marigold gathered that the summons had been delivered in person, and must be quite delicate and urgent.

“I leave with Lord and Lady Sicale within the hour. I have already sent instructions to Raina to begin packing your things. I shall see you soon.”

He dismissed her with a nod of his head, seeming to want to say more, but refraining. Marigold went back to her rooms.

***

That evening, Marigold lay awake in bed. The day’s flurry of activity, rather than tiring her out, had set her brain tingling. Raina and the other household staff had seen to the packing of her clothing, books to study, and other personal effects. She had been left to her own devices to pack a small bag full of whatever she wished to take personally, which consisted largely of the books she was reading for pleasure, a sketchbook, some colored inks, and a variety of colored and graphite pencils. She had nearly everything, but one thing remained she wanted to take.

She rolled over and over, pondering, before finally sitting bolt upright, coming to a decision. Flickering her eyes to golden cat-eyes, she slipped out of bed and put on her tunic and leggings, boots and cloak. She took a tiny glass vial from her dressing table. It fit in the palm of her hand. The vial had a narrow mouth and neck, with a very small silicone stopper in it, and a bulbous base. Delicate filigree metalwork around the neck sported a loop through which she threaded a fine silver chain. She put the chain around her neck and hid it under her tunic.

As Marigold had done the previous night, she flung open the window, and let herself down silently with the rope. She flew over the deer trail to her secluded riverside swimming spot, where she whistled a slightly different nanotune than the night before. The swarm came out of its hiding place in the hollow tree. Instead of swirling around her and transforming her lower body into a sleek, aquatic creature, the nanoswarm poured into the vial around her neck, which she held aloft.

Marigold replaced the stopper in the vial and hurried back to her room. The implications of bringing the nanoswarm to the Palace could be disastrous. Aside from her own swarm, nanoswarms had not been seen in hundreds of years. There were rumors of wild swarms, but no official reports existed, much like the mythical creatures she enjoyed reading about in her books.

Marigold’s nanoswarm had been with her for as long as she could remember. It was her secret, shared only with Raina. She could not leave her swarm for more than a few days without missing them terribly, and based on the amount Raina and the others had packed, this trip would be much longer than a few days.

Comforted by the swarm’s nearness, but still terrified at the prospect of her visit to the Palace, Marigold fell into an uneasy sleep.
