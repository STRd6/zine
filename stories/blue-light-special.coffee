Blue Light Special

“You know, I really want some cookies.” Elo said. She sat on a cushion on top of a tarp spread on the ground in front of their small campfire and whittled a piece of wood, periodically tossing the shavings into the fire. The warm glow bathed her deft fingers, tired face, and honey-colored hair with a soft light, and faintly illuminated the oak trees around them in the pressing darkness.

“We can break camp tomorrow, move on, and see what we can find on the way,” Jib replied, as he munched some popcorn and scratched his dark beard. He scooted his log seat closer to the fire and buttoned his shearling jacket to keep out the fine mist rolling in among the trees.

“I don’t want to break camp,” Elo protested. “I like it here. We should stay a while. I just want to have some cookies.” She looked around their camp: at Jib on his stump; at Poli beside her on the tarp, seated on her own cushion; at their reliable and well-used tent; at the horses draped with their blankets; at the clean dishes drying fireside. This was a good place. She rubbed her ever-growing abdomen. The tiny person ensconced within dragged a heel over her insides in response.

“Okay, we won’t break camp, then. We can just go to town tomorrow. We need some other supplies anyway.” Jib raised his lanky body to pass the popcorn to Poli, who took the enameled bowl and placed it between her and Elo.

Poli offered the popcorn to Elo. “Here, have some popcorn. That will help take your mind off the craving.”

Elo knitted her brows. “No, it won’t. It’s not the same and you know it.”

“Yeah, okay. I know. It’s not. But it’s what we have,” Poli smiled gently, hoping to diffuse the situation.

“Why can’t you just go get some now? We didn’t camp that far from town, and it’s not that late,” Elo pleaded.

“Because it’s going to rain soon, and because I’m tired, and because we decide things together, not based on whim,” Jib retorted grumpily.

“Pleeeeeease! I really, really want them. I’m tired too and my back hurts from hauling this baby around and I just want to have some cookies. Is that too much to ask?” Elo burst into tears.

“Elo, please don’t cry.” Poli’s red curls bounced as she snapped her head up to glare at Jib. She enfolded Elo in a hug, and Elo sobbed harder on the petite woman’s shoulder.

“Poli, come on,” Jib sighed. “Get Elo settled in the tent and you and I will go tonight. Let’s get moving so we’re not caught in too much rain on the way back.”

Gabe sat on a cold concrete bench at a cold, round, concrete table, eating cold pizza under a murky and unforgiving sky in which clouds entirely obscured the stars, and in which mist threatened to give way to outright rain. He reflected miserably that of all the ways to eat pizza, this was probably the second-worst. The worst would be back in the break room with the other Kmart employees, where they would have excited yet hushed conversations that did not include him, the night manager.

The table he was sitting at had recently had a fiberglass umbrella to provide meager protection against the elements. Last week, however, seven drunk teenagers had removed it to use as a boat in a very large puddle at the back of the parking lot and it had not been seen since. The sky began to spit at him, and he thought, “At least the sky is doing what they’re all thinking.”

Gabe looked up the nearly deserted road and noticed two large figures with an odd gait. They resolved into a tall, bearded man and a petite, redheaded woman, each on horseback, emerging from the mist and entering the Kmart parking lot. Amused, Gabe wondered whether the pair might tie their horses up to the bike racks, or find a parking space near a lamp post and hitch them there, or tether them to a tree.

The man and woman did none of these things. They simply rode the horses through the automatic doors and into the Kmart. Gabe took a moment to process this. He started to get up, looked at his phone, noticed ten minutes remained of his break, and sat back down.

Poli dismounted inside the doors and hitched up a shopping cart to her horse. She nimbly saddled up again, and she and Jib then began perusing the aisles of the Kmart and checking the items off their list.

“Sir? Miss? Can I help you?” an employee demanded tersely, body language suggesting the only help would be toward an exit.

“Yes, thank you. We are looking for cookies such as would satisfy a pregnancy craving,” Jib replied. He placed some batteries in their cart.

“Cookies? Aisle 12A,” the employee responded automatically, then shook her head.  “The horses. You can’t have them in here. You’ll have to take them outside.” The employee was joined by two others, all of them looking simultaneously stern and bewildered.

They reached the aisle’s endcap. “Ooh, look, nut mixes are on sale,” Poli grinned.

“Go ahead and get a few,” Jib called to her as he rode ahead to select some prenatal vitamins and toothpaste.

“Miss, please. The two of you need to take the horses outside,” the employee wheedled.  As if to respond, Poli’s horse lifted its tail and dropped a steaming load near the employee’s boot. The employee leapt back, dismayed.

“Oh, no, I’m afraid that won’t be possible. These are our service animals,” Poli chirped sweetly.

The employees huddled together. “Where’s Gabe?” they worried. They barked into walkie-talkies to Gabe to come over here RIGHT NOW and received no response.

Poli caught up with Jib and together they loaded dry beans and rice into the cart. Suddenly, a voice spoke, as if from the heavens, and a flashing blue light punctuated the announcement:

“Attention, Kmart shoppers! Blue light special on Aisle 12A. Tedwich Sandwich Cookies, buy two, get one free!”

“We have to get those for Elo. I bet they’ll be perfect!” Poli shouted to Jib, and she urged her horse forward. Jib rode after her, followed by the three ineffectual employees, and an ever-growing crowd of onlookers.

Aisle 12A displayed an alarming variety of cookies, snack cakes, and other treats, and Poli and Jib were, for the first time, ill at ease in the Kmart. A small girl with braids and cutoff jeans approached them.

“Here you go,” she smiled shyly, handing up a box. 

“Thank you,” Jib smiled back. He tore into the box and passed a handful of the Tedwich cookies to Poli. They sampled the miniature bear-shaped cinnamon cookies sandwiching a vanilla cream filling. They were, indeed, exactly what Elo would love.

“Can you help us load our cart with every box there is?” Poli asked.

“Not every box. I want to have three for myself,” the girl quickly replied.

“Done.”

With all but three boxes of Tedwich cookies in their cart, the only thing left was to find some ice cream to go with them. This expedition caused no small amount of chaos in the freezer case aisle when a small, yappy dog in a handbag spooked the horses, which in turn sent the crowd scattering in all directions. Fortunately, it also resulted in Jib’s horse being perfectly positioned in front of a case containing pint after pint of ice cream. They selected one of chocolate and one of vanilla, and Jib and Poli rode to the checkout.

Poli pulled a small wooden box from her canvas messenger bag and handed it down to the cashier. “This is a very rare and ancient turtle, carved from an unknown precious stone to bring the bearer untold riches. It is more than enough payment for these goods in our cart.”

Poli and Jib rode out of the store, cart still in tow, as Gabe came back in. The two riders disappeared into the night.

The employees surrounded him. Gabe said nothing. He strolled through the store, surveying the relative lack of damage, the confused shoppers, and the piles of manure, and he grinned as he reached for his walkie-talkie.

“Cleanup on Aisles 6, 7, 10, and 12. Better get a shovel.”

Elo drifted to sleep that night, completely content, filled with cookies and ice cream. She dreamed of a girl with braids and cutoff jeans, holding boxes and boxes of Tedwich cookies stacked higher than she was tall. She flew above the girl as a deep blue light bathed them both.

“What is your name?” Elo asked.

“Theodosia,” the girl answered. The girl flew up to meet Elo and they soared effortlessly through the ceiling and out into the mist.

Three months later, in the middle of another rainy night, Elo gave birth to a baby girl. The child was dusted with cinnamon freckles and looked up at Elo with the bluest eyes she had ever seen. She named the girl Theodosia.
