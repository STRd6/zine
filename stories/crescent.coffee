“Look, Mom, I made a moon!”
She holds aloft a crescent bitten from cereal,
and I feel a tug on my memory:
not the usual familiarity
of the Earth’s twirling, ever-changing little sister
but something deeper, and more intimate,
like a great truth,
a resonance of great importance,
had been uncovered within my mind as I slept,
and was lost upon waking.
And then she ate the moon.
