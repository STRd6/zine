Dungeon Crawl with Cliffford!

One sunny day, Cliffford the big rad dog was playing at the park with his friends U-Bone and Cloe. They chased each other through the playground, around the play structures, and through the sand. Children squealed with delight to see Cliffford jump right over the swing set in his excitement. “He’s so big! He can jump over things! Heehee!” they giggled. THUMP! went Cliffford’s paws as he landed on the grassy field, and Cloe and U-Bone followed right behind.

The dogs dashed through a soccer game, U-Bone stopping to bite at the ball, and Cleo weaving her way through at least four players’ legs. They emerged on the other side of the field at the northernmost edge of the park, where the well-kept field gave way to a little meadow, and then the woods.

Cliffford flopped down in a shady spot, and Cloe and U-Bone stood panting next to him. Cool breezes blew in from the ocean, rippling the leaves on the trees and the long meadow-grass.

“What do you guys want to do now?” Cliffford asked. “I could really go for a nap.”
“Yeah, a nap sounds good,” U-Bone replied, snuggling up beside him.
“We could nap, but what about going back and trying to get that Frisbee over there?” Cloe asked.
“Mmphuhuhmph,” U-Bone answered, already half-asleep.
“All right, fine,” Cloe huffed. Cliffford began to doze as well, so Cloe meandered away, sniffing around the meadow.

“Cliffford? U-BONE! WAAAAAAAKE UP!” Cliffford and U-Bone bolted awake, jumping to their feet.
“HAHAHAHA! Did I scare you?” Cloe yipped, bouncing around in circles around her two friends as excitement practically dripped off her.
“What’s up, Cloe?” U-Bone asked.
“I found something neat. Come with me!”

Without looking behind her to see if the others were coming, Cloe took off at a run down a path that Cliffford and U-Bone hadn’t seen until now. The path wound through the woods, the trees getting taller and closer together the further along they went. The terrain became rockier, and a few times they dodged around large boulders as they continued forward.

Around a bend in the path, Cloe came into view, her tail wagging wildly. She stood in front of a large outcropping with a dark, conveniently Cliffford-sized opening in its face.

“This place gives me the willies,” U-Bone said, looking around. He noticed crumbling rock around the entrance, which on closer inspection, he realized were carvings of some kind of dog-dragon looking menacingly into his eyes. U-Bone decided not to inspect it further. It was definitely a dungeon.

“So? Come on, guys, what do you think? Want to go inside?” Cloe asked.
“You know, I’d really rather just go back and see if we can score any free snacks from the picnic blankets,” U-Bone muttered, looking uncomfortable.
“Yeah, I’m not even sure I’ll fit in there,” Cliffford said.
“Uh, Cliffford, did you see the part up there in the paragraph before last where it said the entrance is conveniently Cliffford-sized? Do you remember the last story where you fit into the double doors of a shopping mall? You can’t worm your way out of this.” Cloe looked smug. “I’m sure there are all kinds of interesting things to eat in there anyway, U-Bone.”
“Oh, all right,” Cliffford and U-Bone sighed. “Let’s enter the dungeon.”
“Fuck* yeah!” Cloe shouted, and ran inside.

*If you’re reading this to young children for some reason, have fun substituting the word of your choice. May we suggest fizzle? Forward? Finagle? Forsooth? Just say it with all the energy of a dog hopped up on self-righteousness and you’ll be fine.

Cliffford did, indeed, fit inside the entrance, as well as the tunnel just inside. There were plenty of smells wafting around, and his head whipped from side to side trying to take them all in. In doing so, he failed to look at the ground ahead, and he tripped.

“Look, a bone!” Clifford said happily as he scrambled up off the floor. Things were beginning to look up. Cliffford picked it up and gnawed around on it as they trekked deeper into the dungeon.

U-Bone noticed some orangish clingy stuff close to the bottom of the cave wall. He sniffed it. “Slime mold? Don’t mind if I do.” He nibbled a little, and then scarfed the rest down in just a few bites. Not bad. He feels invigorated!

“Oh, wow, another one!” Cliffford shouted around the bone in his mouth as he stopped to pick up a second bone. “And another! This dungeon is turning out to be pretty great.”

“I told you!” Cloe grinned. She bounded down the tunnel ahead of the other two. “Come on, there’s a staircase that’s leading down!”

The three dogs descended the stairs into near-blackness. No longer lit by the daylight streaming in from the entrance, the dungeon was distinctly murkier. Something brushed past U-Bone’s ear and he snapped at it.

“I found a torch!” Cloe said. “I wonder if there’s any way to light it. We’d better take it with us. She grabbed the torch in her mouth and crept into the gloom.

The trio inched forward, sniffing and listening before moving along the path. Eventually, the darkness lifted a little bit, and they approached a second, lit torch set into a sconce in the wall. Even Cloe felt better once she lit their torch, which now illuminated a small circle around them.

Something else glinted in the darkness just beyond them. Cloe moved closer and the dogs saw a beautifully crafted, lightweight sword lying on the dusty floor. “This one’s all yours, U-Bone,” Cliffford said through his mouthful of bones. U-Bone gingerly took the sword and swung it around a few times. Cliffford and Cloe saw his apprehension turn to excitement as U-Bone growled, advanced on a spiderweb, and dispatched it.

U-Bone stumbled upon a sheath and baldric for the sword a short distance away, and strapped them on. BOSS! A few turns of the path later, and the dogs found another staircase down. Come on, it’s a dungeon crawl. Of course they found another staircase!

The dogs explored further and deeper into the dungeon. Cliffford’s mouth was crammed as full as possible with bones, and he looked sadly at each one he had to leave behind as they pressed on.

“Humuhlauhsunrrmmmuh,” said the big rad dog, furrowing his brows.
“Hmm?” asked Cloe, through the side of her mouth around the torch.
“Mmmmahhhhh!” U-Bone hollered as he turned a bat into a meat icon that dropped a large leather satchel and a helmet that fit no one.

Cliffford pawed the satchel with his foot, turning it over. It flopped open. There was nothing inside, so he started to put his bones in his bag. He was delighted to find every single one fit, and then some. “Huzzzah! A bag of holding!” he shouted, and raced forward to find more.

Instead, Cliffford found a kobold corpse. He sniffed it, hesitated, sniffed again, shrugged, and dug in. “Any good?” U-Bone asked, sheathing his sword. “Ugh, no, this corpse is definitely tainted,” Clifford said, not lifting his head from his meal. U-Bone sniffed the corpse and took a bite. “Yeah, man, ugh, that’s rank. Don’t eat those guys.”

The dogs began to feel thirsty from all their exertions, and conveniently the next level had some water! They descended the stairs to find themselves standing in front of an expanse of shimmering deep blue-violet, a gorgeous underground lake.

“It’s beautiful!” Cloe sighed. She bent down to drink, and U-Bone followed suit. Cliffford bent over, too, and as he drank, his stomach began to twist. “Uh, guys?” Cliffford said. “HUUUGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHH,” he retched, and vomited into the lake. He lay down in the mud on the shore.

U-Bone noticed a sign nearby. “Lake of Eternal Cleanliness,” he read.
“Dude, not anymore. HAH!” Cloe barked.

Just then, they heard a shout ahead of them. A small, crotchety dog-dragon-hermit thing emerged from a hovel at the edge of the lake.

“THIS LAKE HAS BEEN PRISTINE FOR NINE HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN YEARS!” shouted the angry lake-keeper, shaking one fist wildly and wielding a Staff of Glowing Menace in the other. Cloe backed up, and U-Bone got his sword ready, but Cliffford still lay in the mud, groaning.

Just then, Cliffford happened to twist his head at just the right angle to notice a small vial of something pink resting in the mud by his ear. He quaffed this (come on, Cliffford, stop ingesting all these questionable things!) and instantly felt not only invigorated, but also amplified! Cliffford barked an ear-poppingly loud enchanted bark, which repelled the lake-keeper and sent him splashing into the Lake of Recent Uncleanliness, and the three friends hauled ass* (*apples?) further down into the dungeon.

By the time the dogs felt like they could slow down, they had descended what felt like (and was) the umpteenth flight of stairs. They came out in front of a small, narrow opening. Cloe held the torch while U-Bone scouted inside, and he noticed that the path was twistier and turnier than the rest of the dungeon had been.

“I think it’s a labyrinth,” he said, as the two smaller dogs emerged from the entrance. “But Cliffford, I don’t think you’re going to fit.”

“I’m going to look around and see if there’s any way around,” Cloe said, and trotted off. She came back a few moments later with a rolled-up piece of paper.

“Hey guys, what’s this?” she said, dropping it in front of the others.
“It’s some kind of scroll,” U-Bone said, nosing at it.
“Is that like some kind of newspaper?” she asked. “I love newspapers! I like to go out really early in the morning right after they’re delivered, slide them out of their plastic sleeve, and shaaaaaaaaaake them so hard that they get all shredded up! It’s so funny!” Cloe giggled. “I’m going to go for it. I think this scroll is going to be pretty satisfying too.”

Cloe whipped her head back and forth, and the scroll unfurled, revealing the text GRRMOC UHLPROOT in old-timey writing, and she stopped. “Grrmoc uhlproot?” she asked, and instantly, Cliffford fell to the ground. Yeah, the scroll was totally cursed.

A moment later, Cliffford was back up again, only now he was the size of a normal dog. Yup!

This was a very useful development for our plot, because they heard shouts from the top of the stairs. The angry lake-keeper’s scratchy toenails clicked on the stone treads as he skittered down toward them.

The dogs wasted no time, and all three dove right into the entrance to the labyrinth. They tried their best to stay together, but Clifford, unused to being tiny, lagged behind. He felt weak, and needed food badly.

The other dogs called encouragingly behind them for Cliffford to hurry the fuck* (*fart!) up, but he stopped short when he saw some meat lying in a corner. It was another kobold corpse. His brain said to him, “Hey, wait a second, Cliffford,” but then he discovered he’d already begun to eat it.

Oh yeah, this one’s tainted too.

The dogs all managed to find their way to the center of the labyrinth in enough time to marvel at the treasure there: the Squeaky Toy of Canidae. A lovely, fuzzy, stuffed squirrel with a magical squeaker that never, ever breaks, and that is also enchanted with legendary but vague special powers.

Their marvel was cut short by the angry lake-keeper, who barreled into the center of the labyrinth behind them, hollering. Cliffford turned to face the lake-keeper, and felt a familiar twist in his stomach as he did so.

“HGGGGGRRRRRRRPH!” he grunted, spewing vomit all over the lake-keeper. It sizzled as it hit the lake-keeper, dealing quite a bit of damage. It also broke a curse on the lake-keeper, and from his crusty, smelly robes emerged Moc.

“What is going on? I’ve been in this godforsaken cave for the last five and a half days* (*937 dog-hours!). The whole time I’ve been having repeated nightmares that I’m some sort of disgusting hermit encamped by a lake.” He shook himself, and droplets of vomit spattered the labyrinth walls.

“And you, Cliffford, your vomit seems to be a recurring feature in my nightmares as well. Can we please get out of here?” Moc huffed, as he caught a whiff of the tainted, partially digested kobold corpse clinging to his fur.

“Hey, guys, I think Moc’s curse isn’t the only one that’s broken!!” Cliffford shouted, as he began to grow and grow. The rapid growth broke down the walls of the labyrinth, revealing a clear path to the exit.

Cliffford stuffed the Squeaky Toy of Canidae into his bag of holding, and all the other dogs hopped on his back and held on for dear life as Cliffford sprinted out of the dungeon and back into the sunshine of the park.

After rolling around in the grass to get the last of the spiderwebs and vomit off themselves, the dogs went back to Cliffford’s doghouse, where they all feasted on the bones from Cliffford’s bag of holding and took turns with the Squeaky Toy of Canidae.

The friends all agreed that it was the best dungeon crawl ever!

THE END!!
