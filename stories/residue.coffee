                                 RESIDUE
                                 =======

Jules, my friend, used to take her new
car to Viretta Park. After a workday
filled with tickets and meetings, she
sometimes drove the five miles to this
one-block wide, one-block tall park at
the northeast coast of the city where
people prospered. There, tourists via
Ubers and Lyfts came to see the Kurt
Cobain bench. But Jules would arrive at
the park and drive past. She would not
stop. She would not get out. You cannot
see the bench from the road. It was
usually dark after work. She told no one
about these trips until years later.

Jules, our protagonist, (as far as she
could figure) had no conscious logic for
her actions. Without it the story
refused to hang together. It was a
sequence of events united by space and
time but lacking guts hearts or brains.
It was a propulsion without a
propellant. It defied narrative
structure and, without it, lacked
rhythm. Jules, being a capable
self-aware adult, knew she was acting
out of an impulse but it seemed to her
that the situation warranted impulse.
And, at that time and at the time this
was written, gas was cheap. I can safely
say also that she was not sad; she was
not one of those people who indulged in
the habit of moping about events beyond
their control. Some people are just
strong this way.

In my presence Jules narrated the story
with the blank point of view of an
omniscient witness. There was a lull in
the conversation, this story was told,
and then we moved on. She wore a thin
jacket and a wry frown and we were high,
more high than usual. I, after giving it
some consideration, had a grocery list
of questions. Why Kurt Cobain; why
didn't you tell me earlier; and did you
do it to feel an impossible, cosmic
connection to something bigger than
yourself, a feeling for which I cannot
do justice but can tell you that, for
me, is close to the sensation of an
egg's cracking against the chest
cavity's outer wall. But from looking at
her I knew then, just as she had always
known, it was not as if there were
answers and she were ignorant of them.
There just were no answers. At the time
these events I am writing about took
place, she was stuck in a temporary city
at a temporary time of her life. In my
country, where you work for years and
years in search of permanent residence
status and where adults values
friendship but few pursue them, it seems
harder than other places to let out
these prickly stories. I imagine people
all around me have them, though – yarn
wound and knotted by fingers
absentmindedly rubbing the threads
together.

After eighteen months, Jules packed up
all her furniture and moved away. She
drove all the way through America.
