        p No matter if you guy/girl or whatever, Cheevos impress people. It's almost like saying 'Well, I got tons of Cheevos. There are tons of people online that are interested and respect me."

        p You might be thinking 'Oh that's complete BS, I personally don't care about Cheevos when dating'. And yeah, you are probably telling the truth, but it's in your sub-concious.  Sort of like how girls always like the bad guy, but never admit it.

        p Braggin about your Cheevos sometimes makes you look conceited, but that's a good thing.  It like how celebraties look conceited because they're rolling VIP into clubs and you're stuck in line.

        p 'Brewer' asks 'What happens if you're cheevo talking at a bar, club or party and someone says they have more cheevos that you?'

        p Well, hopefully they are just hating and are lying. First look up their score with your cellphone, make sure you have a page bookmarked where you can check. If you catch them in a lie, you look even better. If they are telling the truth and have more Cheevos than you, leave. Nothing else you can do. Buy the person a drink and leave, unless you're willing to look 2nd best. If you brought a date, odds are she's going to be impressed with the higher gamer score and ditch you. Get out as soon as you can and go to some other party.
