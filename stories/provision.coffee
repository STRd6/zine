One hundred or so years from now, when I
die, my descendants come across this
rich text file while going through the
drawers and the suitcases in my husband
and I's house under the pretense of
cleaning. They will try to understand
who we were and if we ever were more
than just parents. They will have
problems with technology that has yet to
be invented; they will have kids and
lovers that I will never meet.

My husband will die twenty or so years
before me. He will fall asleep at Sam's
Club and refuse to wake up. A
badly-shaken mid-level Sam's Club
franchise manager with kind eyes and a
polo T-shirt and exactly one earring
will knock on my door and deliver the
news. I will feel weak and, 18 hours
later, I will cry.

I want you to know how ordinary I was. I
wanted to be one person and then I ended
up being someone else. Cumulatively I
thought I had serious fantasies about
marrying three different people and,
after college, I ended up marrying the
second. I was part of a dozen thousand
who fled to Canada during the dark
years. My grocer patiently taught me how
to say 100 words in a French-Canadian
accent and gave me the courage to eat
ugly vegetables. I could have traveled
more and been happy. I could have not
traveled more and been happy.

The worst part about traveling is all
the advertisements for foreign brands.
Walking home at night under the
spotlights of billboards with which you
cannot empathize is a piercing kind of
loneliness. The best part about
traveling is meeting all the other
expats in your city, who each is tacitly
a member of a busy and tired club.

My parents were Armenian mathematicians.
They left their country, which gave me
the courage to leave mine. They were
constantly worried about me and, to
distract themselves, they bought and
flipped real estate. The first time you
buy a house it seems impossible that
each room will fill with the right
furniture and the each wall will have
the right artwork. The second time is
twice as easy; and the third is twice
that. They met one hundred or so
different people that way, which I think
somehow made my relationship with them
better or at least easier. Toward the
end they will play gin with their
neighbors in the morning and watch
Armenian television in the afternoon, on
a small satellite modem that only
Armenians know where to buy. They forgot
English first, then walking, then
breathing. Acting on this information, I
will try to die much faster.

The early 2010s will be remembered
fondly as a simpler time, and
additionally I want to add they were my
favorite years. The late 2040s were good
too, as were the 2060s. It will become
difficult to separate the objective
quality of a time period from how much
of a burden my body becomes. Every year
I will buy clothes that looked like all
the clothes I owned fifteen years ago
until, one day, I throw everything out
that isn't white and blue. I will die in
a white blouse and blue shorts. In death
I will stop looking cute and start
looking serene.

Though I know some facts about the
future I have a great deal of questions.
What are the food trends now? Are there
any new bands that sound like the old
bands I liked? Do radiators still break
during the coldest week?

My husband and I ran into each other in
three different cities. The first two
times we recognized in each other an
understanding that the timing was off.
The third time we fucked in a friend's
closet, groping each other like we were
younger, beneath layers of woolen duvets
that we by accident pulled down. It
seemed tawdry and sticky at the time and
now it's just a sentence.

Into our lives we carved out space for
each other. We put up load-bearing
beams. We added good thick curtains and
a little OLED display that read the
amount of humidity in the air. We agreed
to never make the other person sleep on
the couch, as we wanted ours to be
filled with the flatulence of our
friends. We threw the best parties. We
were an unstoppable hosting machine. We
figured out that a party becomes the
memory of a party. It happens one or two
days after the party, when the
conversation and the discoveries curdle
into something distant and bittersweet.

The city will build a subway station
near us in 2031 after years of private
funding into subterranean
infrastructure. The money will come from
tech moguls looking to survive zombies
and/or climate change, but a subway
station is a subway station. One late
night, as we step off the train on our
way home, we will walk past a woman
wearing a bright striped parka. I will
turn my head to get a second look and
she will not be there. I will crook my
head to see behind the poles until my
neck hurts, and still I will see no one.
I will turn to my husband, who sees my
face, and we will walk home with his
head lying on my shoulder and his hand
lying on my chest so that my
inexplicably racing heartbeat will bang
and shudder against his hand like a
hurricane's wind against the shutters of
a house where nobody has ever lived.
