# Around the World in 20 Years and a Weekend

The history of human progress is rife with us entering things. [Tombs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raiders_of_the_Lost_Ark), [dragons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enter_the_Dragon), [voids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enter_the_Void), even [gungeons](http://dodgeroll.com/gungeon/). 


But have you ever stopped to think about what fuels this endless urge to ingress? Rather fearlessly, I decided to find out.

It's now 20 years later. I've waded through the jungles of the Amazon, skied the slopes of Norway, swam the Ganges, and braved long lines. I've lost a lot too. The years have aged me dramatically - I'm a hot mess. And I lost my phone a month ago, so my friends and family are dead to me now. 

Here's what I've learned on my journey,

The Freudian says we want to go in things for obvious sex reasons. Freudian? More like ‘Fraud’-ian, right? Har har.

My Peyote spirit animal is a horse. Under the desert sky he whispers in my ear that what we really want is to enter the stable of the mind. I'm not so sure though. I don't even really like normal earthly stables.

After the peyote trip, things get a little fuzzy. I stumbled into a place. It was either a diner, a drive-in, or a dive. There I met TV food guy Guy Fieri. Between mouthfuls of cheese and enthusiasm, he proclaimed that we enter so that we may exit.  

“We’re all searching for something that’s everything we imagine it to be.”

...

If I'm honest, this odyssey only really took a weekend. After that I didn't really feel like going back to work, so I just hung out for a while.
